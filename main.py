"""
     Got tired of scrolling up and down for functions, 
     figured out a way for encapuslation. Im still a bit 
     confused agout scope here, but it seems like the session
     object is shared amongst all the functions the same way, 
     with them also being accessible here. 
    
    tried making a database manager module but had problems with scope  

    Menu App:
        a. Enroll Student in a Section 
            add_student_section, add_section_student
        b. Unenroll Student from a section
            delete_student_section, delete_section_student
        c. List Enrollments
            list_student_section, list_section_student
        d. Delete a section
            delete_student_section, delete_section_student
        e. Delete a student
